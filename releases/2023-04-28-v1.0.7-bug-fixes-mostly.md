**FIXED**: 

- Trasfer fees were off by a factor of 10.
- Salvage prices were corrected to match the highest possible sell price.
- Summary tab stats were showing incorrect values.
- Work order SCU summary was off by a factor of 10.
- Lots of little rounding and math tweaks (mostly found by users).
- Some users were getting a white-screen error when trying to create a session. The symptom has been patched but the cause of this is still under investigation.
- Stats were tweaked and now update every hour.
- Several new developer tools were added to help track down bugs.
- Added a UserID section to the profile page so users can submit it with bug reports to help reproduce issues.

Also I've opened up a new code branch for 3.19 in order to keep bug fixing in 3.18.2 seperate from the drastic changes to mining we're all expecting in 3.19.
