- Loadouts now have modal to confirm deletion
- Checkbox to sell workorders that aren't yours is now disabled
- User add modal now reacts properly to typing
- Loadouts can now use lasers of lower powers (i.e. you can use a Helix 1 on a Mole if you want). They have been sorted to the bottom and labeled clearly as this is totally valid but not very common.
- Misc other behaviour tweaks
