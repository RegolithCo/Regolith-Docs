This is a stepping stone to Star Citizen 4.0

### Session Roles!

- Session roles and ship roles can now be set. 
- You can also add crew shares to a work order by role (i.e. security people get a split of 10% of the profits etc.)

### For Pyro:

- **New Refineries**: New refineries for Pyro including: Checkmate, Ruin, Orbituary and Stanton Gateway.
- **New Materials:** Ice, Stileron, Tin, Silicon and Riccite. NOTE: PRICE SYNCHIGN FOR THESE MATERIALS IS NOT YET AVAILABLE.
- **System Filter**: Optionally limit your refineries, markets and gravity wells to one system.

### Session Changes:

- Sessions now close after 48 hours instead of 12 hours
- Closed sessions can now be re-opened!
- Much better state synching means session changes appear much faster on all clients and take way less server resources.

### Other fixes:

- Percentage and share values can now have up to 2 decimal places.
- Many little bug fixes.
- **NOTE:** Temporarily disabled the "Users must be a member of a discord server to join this session." until a fix can be found. Hopefully this will be back soon.
