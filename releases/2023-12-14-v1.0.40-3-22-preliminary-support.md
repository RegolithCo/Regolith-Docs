This is just a quick patch to get `Construction Materials` into the game for the new salvaging workflow. 

#### New features

- `Construction Materials` and a salvage ore picker have been added. **Prices for construction materials are not in yet (Waiting on UEX)!!** so you will need to add them manually for a day or two.

#### Fixes

- Some context menu handling errors have been solved and right-clicking inside the session tools hould be allowed again.
- Icon and font adjustments
