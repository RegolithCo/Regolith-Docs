This patch is designed to unblock a bunch of new features I've been wanting to work on but couldn't until the foundation was laid. Also a couple of little fixes.

- Major engine updates for NodeJS, yarn etc.
    - (This was blocking all other work so it's huge to have it done!)
- Increased gem cluster count to 30
- Removed the 3.19 warnings
- Price updates
- Removed "UNKNOWN" text in the user list (better user lists coming soon!)
- Slight rework of the timeline page including Avatar groups (better timeline coming soon!)
