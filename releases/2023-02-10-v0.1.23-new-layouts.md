- After lots of (mostly positive) feedback I've redone the session views and profile pages
- New "Summary" tab on the session page 
- Session settings is now a tab. The modal was just too much muchness.
- New "Pay all" feature on the summary tab lets you pay all shares at once.
- Slightly better mobile support (still a ways to go though)
- Slightly faster queries
- Improvements to the timeline view
- Fun new backgrounds on some of the pages
- Still more login/logout timeout fixes
- Fixed a couple of rounding errors and math glitches
