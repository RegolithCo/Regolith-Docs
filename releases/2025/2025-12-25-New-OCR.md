This is kind of a massive release for regolith under the good. A new OCR enginer and lots of major engine changes so I expect there will still be some bugs to work out so please be patient with us while we find ans squash them.

- OCR now works in-browser without making a server requestand has been upgraded to support some of the new UI layouts from vehicles in 4.5.
- BUG FIX: Problem with work orders > 2 billion aUEC causing errors. Upgraded the entire system to use a bigger type of integer.
- Refinery bonuses now pull from UEX and method bonuses have been updated to fit the new nerfs in 4.5.
- Performance improvements across the board.
- Removing a couple of calculators almost nobody was using that have now been replaced by much better ones at [UEX Corp](https://uexcorp.space/mining/refineries).
- Upgraded to ES2020: Upgrading the entire codebase to ES2020 to support BigInt natively. This should help with large numbers in work orders and crew shares.

You may also notice a lot fo the artwork has been removed from the site. I've made the decision to remove all AI-generated graphics from the site, mainly for ethical reasons. If anyone is interested in the "why" of it all I wrote a blog post about it [here](https://docs.regolith.rocks/blog/ai-art-ethics).
