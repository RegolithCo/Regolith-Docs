title: 1.4.3 - Discord Permissions fix
date: 2025-11-10

Lots of folks were having issues with the discord permissions and org membership stuff. This was mainly because of how differently each Discord guild is managed and set up, which made it difficult to find common permissions that we could use as "enough" to grant access. The Discord permissions needed to set allegiance to the Survey Corps have been relaxed and we've switched from an "AND" policy to an "OR" policy to try and catch more cases.

This should unlock a lot of users but please get in touch if you still see "missing permissions" and don't understand why.
