This is a tiny update to fix some very small nagging bugs

- Rock mass limits have been updated to 200,000
- Work order and scouting find deletions are optimistic now so they should feel snappier.
- Added a note to the FAQ about Ad-blockers sometimes interferring with login.
- Several other bugs too esoteric or boring to mention.
