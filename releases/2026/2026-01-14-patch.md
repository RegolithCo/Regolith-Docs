This is a quick patch to address some of the issues found in the 1.5.0/1.5.1 releases.

- **BUGFIX: Dashboard stats not showing correct values**: Last month's BigInt upgrades are still causing some problems but slowly we are finding them all.
- **BUGFIX: Golem Laser Reset**: Fixed an issue in the loadout calculator where selecting "none" for a module/gadget would incorrectly change the Golem's laser head back to a Prospector laser.
- **Performance Optimization**: Disabled the "VHS" background effect to improve site performance and reduce jank.
- **Better Rounding**: Improved precision and rounding in ore percentage calculations to prevent values from exceeding 100%.
- **BUGFIX**: Prevent doubling up of ores which creates shadow ores and skews the total in a way the user can't fix.
- **Discord Auth Fix**: Resolved a bug with local storage persistence for Discord authentication.
- **Gravity Well Hierarchy**: Fixed a bug where some gravity well and location options were not appearing correctly in the dropdowns.
- **General Cleanup**: Fixed various background display issues and minor spelling errors.
- **General Server Performance**: Added a server-side improvement to reduce overall API calls.
