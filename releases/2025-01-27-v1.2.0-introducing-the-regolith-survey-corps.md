Introducing the **Regolith Survey Corps!** This is a new opt-in feature that will allow you to share your scouting finds with the community. This is a great way to help other miners find the best rocks and to get a little recognition for your hard work (if you want it).

The survey corps also creates an incentive to scan rocks even if you don't mine them and gives users a reason to get away hunting the most valuable rocks and find joy in the exploration and survey.

Hopefully this will be like a lightweight exploration mechanic while we wait for a better one from CIG!

### Bug Fixes:

- Fixed an issue where people who had set "Lock to discord guild" as their default were unable to unset this setting.
- Upgraded all legacy gravity well data to the new codes.
- Fixed an issue where OCR scans weren't getting their inert material values calculated correctly.
