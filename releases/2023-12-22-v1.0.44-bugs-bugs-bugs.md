- **FIX**: Users in a ship crew can disappear (including the session owner) completely from the user list when the ship captain leaves the session.
- **FIX**: Can't have more than one active module of a single type per laser in the "on" state. (eg. you can't have two surge modules active on a single laser)
- **FIX**: WHen you remove all the ores from a work order the price is now set to zero instead of freezing at the last number.
- **FIX**: No more decimals allowed on crew-share inputs
