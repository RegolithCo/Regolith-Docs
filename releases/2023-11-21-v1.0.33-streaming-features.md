#### Query improvements

- I've optimized a fewqueries in an attempt to get faster load time on session pages.

#### Rock entry card

- You can now enter `instability` and `resistance` values on rocks.
- Ore percentage values now support 2 decimal places.

#### Streaming features

- **Session urls no longer let you join a session** so people won't be able to join the session just by capturing the url from your browser.
- New **session join workflow**. This could still be better but I think it's a little smoother now.
- `Streamer Mode`: in the profile menu. Toggle this on to anonymize all usernames and avatars if you want to share the session on screen without exposing any usernames.
- When exporting `.png` shares you can now choose to anonymize the export to hide all usernames and user avatars (same mechanic as `Streamer Mode`).
