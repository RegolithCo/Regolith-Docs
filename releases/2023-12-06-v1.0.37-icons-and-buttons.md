A number of you have reached out to give some feedback so I've made a few changes to the UI to make it a little more intuitive based on what I've been hearing.

- New explanation for new users whern there are no sessions yet. This will grow later when there are more help materials.
- Changed the add user button to make it both more compact and ituitive. There is also a menu now that includes a way to get the sharing link
- Consistency and improvements around icon choices and tooltip language.
- New menu items in the profile menu for the friend manager and session defaults.
- Profile area now has separate urls for friend list and session defaults.
