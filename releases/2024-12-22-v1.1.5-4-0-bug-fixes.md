4.0 changes a lot so we're probably not done yet but here are a few (mostly OCR) bug fixes.

- BUG Fixed: OCR Capture didn't apply values if there was no Method or Refinery found in the capture.
- BUG Fixed: the refinery UI background dot grid sometimes made it look like yield numbers had a decimal.
- BUG Fixed: inconsistent station names for better refinery lookups 
- BUG Fixed: The workorder split total was sometimes different from the final sell price.
- Updated the scVersion to `4.0.0`.
