Not much to notice here but I completely changed the front-end scaffolding framework I was using. This will cut build times, speed up development and it creates a much smaller javascript package size as a nice added bonus. This kind of regular refactoring is really important if you don't want to always have 8 hours of work before you can implement anything cool.

### Error Handling

- Before we were just seeing "Mutation Error" which is not useful for debugging. Now you can copy the error and send it to the developer.

### Bug Fixes

- Salvaging table now sorts correctly (CMAT and RMCO were reversed and had each other's prices)
- Bug where Substract Transfer Fee wasn't being set correctly
- Bug where expenses aren't being saved properly.
- Shatter damage was showing the wrong color (negative shatter damage is good).
