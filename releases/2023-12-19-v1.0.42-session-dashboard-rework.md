title: "December 19, 2023 - v1.0.42 Session Dashboard rework"

Note: sell prices for some of the new settlements are in.

#### Fixes:

- The session accordion has been reworked to behave better and scale better on different-sized screens. You can collapse the header now by clicking on it to get a little more screen real-estate. 
- On the PNG export screen the final sell price was reduced to a single digit. 
- Put a warning on Google log in until I can solve the problem with the refresh tokens.
- Stats were double counting some workorders and we're now filtering out ludicrous (and obviously fake) amounts from the front page stats.
- Added character counts and limits to session title and notes
