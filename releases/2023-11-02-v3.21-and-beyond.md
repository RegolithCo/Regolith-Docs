This is one of those weird cases where I'm taking away features in a patch. In the latest version of the PU CIG has removed all the refinery paramters we depend on for calculating things like refinery costs. 

- **Refinery expenses on work orders will need to be entered manually until futher notice.**

I'm sure we'll be able to get back to a place where we can bring back these calculations but since we're in a period of heavy flux until Pyro launches with server meshing I'm going to focus all my efforts on 2 things:

1. Getting ready for Pyro, server meshing and anything else they are throwing our way in Q1 of 2024
2. Keeping the app usable in the meantime for the highest number of people.
