3.19 is changing a lot of things and that means a lot of math is going to need to be re-thought, mandatory fields need to be re-evaluated etc. In preparation for this I've started making some of the changes to make Regolith work with 3.19.

1. You will be able create work orders for other people if you're not the ship owner / seller
2. When you sell you can type in the final sell price and this is what will be used for crew shares
3. Prices estimates have been removed in many places. Where they remain I'm adding tooltips to indicate that these values are rough estimates and don't reflect the dynamic pricing in the PU.

Lots of work left to go and 3.19 can still change so stay tuned for price updates and new features!
