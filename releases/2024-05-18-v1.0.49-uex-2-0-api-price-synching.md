The primary fix here is rewriting our price synching scripts to work with the new UEX 2.0 API. This was mostly straightforward but involved some ID type changes so database migration was inevitable. 

Also this was a good opportunity to do some minor refactors in preparation for some new features planned for some time in the future.

HOTFIX: Fixed an issue where users who require discord membership for their sessions were not able to unset it.
HOTFIX: Minor fix to homepage chart for daily view
HOTFIX: Minor fix to Refinery names on data tables
