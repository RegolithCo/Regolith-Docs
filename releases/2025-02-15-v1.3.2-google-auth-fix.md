title: "February 15, 2025 - v1.3.2 Google Auth Fix!"

This is a major rework of the authentication system that aims to fix some of the issues people were having, especially with Google Auth.

- Google Auth should now refresh properly so you don't have to refresh it every hour
- "Report Bug" Menu item added. Now you can report a bug directly from the app and it gets combined with a bunch of sexy context data, stack traces etc. to help us figure out what's going on.
- Error reporting stack added. Hopefully this will let us track the issues people are having even if they aren't reported.
