This is a quick patch to fix two issues that came up:

1. When selecting "Alternate Seller" on a work order the summary tab was not showing all unpaid crew shares correctly
2. When choosing "Share unrefined value" on a work order with a store selected that doesn't allow unrefined ore to be purchased the gross value was being set to zero.
