You can now mark a work order as "Sold" and enter the final sell price. This will update the session stats and the crew shares. This was a little more work than I was hoping and involved a database migration but the results are definitely worth it. 

#### Work Orders

- WorkOrders **"State"** was removed because it was confusing
- **Sold** status is now on the work order line with an interactive checkbox
- **Paid** status is now on the work order line.

All work orders before today have been marked as "Sold" by default because nobody had this control before today. Apologies if this creates confusion.

Also the session list card has been updated to better communicate the state of work orders in a session. You should be able to see at a glance what is sold/unsold vs. paid/unpaid. It also works a little better on mobile.... but only a little.
