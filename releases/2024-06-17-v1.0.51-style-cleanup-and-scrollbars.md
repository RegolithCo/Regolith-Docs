You asked for it! You got it! Scrollbars are back! I know, I know, you're welcome.

This patch introduces a few little fixes that had been building up as well inlcuding:

- Prospector with Mole bags is now a ship option you can choose.
- Scrollbars should be visible wherever appropriate (and hopefully nowhere else).
- The reference numbers table on the work order tool has been restored. 
- A duplicated root DIV was causing some layout issues. This has been removed so hopefully those of you that saw a huge scrollable space under the app shouldn't anymore.
