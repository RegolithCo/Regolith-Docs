- **Login Bug**: Multiple users were reporting the innability to log into the system. This was due to a bug in the login system that was introduced in the last patch. A combination of a library operating a little differently in a newer version and a bug in my code caused the login to fail. This has been fixed and the system is back online. 
- **Extractor Power Loadout**: The extractor power loadout was not being calculated correctly. This has been fixed and the correct values are now being used.
- **Missing columns in loadout module table**: The loadout module table was missing a few columns. This has been fixed.
- **Loadout Bug Fix**: Saved loadouts should now be editable again.
