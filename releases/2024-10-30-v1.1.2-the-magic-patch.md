#### Holy üêÑ you guys, OCR is in!

Ever since I started Regolith I've wanted a better way to capture work orders and rocks scans. Typing all those numbers is tedious and there has to be a better way. Well, now there is!

Now you can capture your work orders and scan rocks in 3 new exciting ways:

1. **Screen Sharing**: Share your screen with Regolith and you can capture work orders and rock scans directly from the game.
2. `ALT + Print Screen` puts a screenshot in the clipboard then `CTRL+V` to paste it directly into your session.
3. **Screenshot Upload**: Load a screenshot of a rock scan or a refinery window and Regolith will read the data directly from the image.

#### Also a few new features that folks were asking for:

- **CSV Downloading** of sessions is back. It's a little jankey but it's there.
- You can now **add *any* team** to a work order's crew shares, not just your own. 
- Several sneaky little bugs that were causing issues with the new features have been squashed.
- The mobile experience has gotten very slightly better. Still a long way to go though.
- Increased the RAM available to certain backend processes. This should significantly reduce load times on the front end.
