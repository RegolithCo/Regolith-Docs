#### Composite Adding tool

Right now when you sell from your ship inventory you need to sell ores one at a time and then add them up. There is now a composite adding tool to help you add up prices as you go.

**Other fixes:**

- Fixing the homepage and stat theming 
- Tweaking and fixing the tabs and menus that were breaking on a lot of mobile devices.
- Misc theme cleanup
