A few quick, easy changes stemming from feedback after a successful live event over at Red Legion org.

- Added all ships to the picker, not just ones with cargo grids or mining holds.
- Better scrolling on the dashboard when there are lots of scouting finds. This component needs rewriting someday but this will keep us going for now.
- FIXED: When you mark the scoutinf find `Abandoned` or `Depleted` it no longer reverts ownership back to the session owner.
- MISC: Typos and wording changes.
