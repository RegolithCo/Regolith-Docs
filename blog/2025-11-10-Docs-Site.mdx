## Docs and a little update

The official API docs for Regolith are something I have wanted to publish for quite a while but I've been holding back because writing good documentation is hard and I never felt it was quite good enough.

Because lots of people have been asking and in the interest of preventing the "perfect" being the enemy of the "good" (or the "good enough") I'm going to release the docs in their current state and then augment it with examples and details.

### https://docs.regolith.rocks

*If anyone wants to help write documentation or if you write some neat scripts or code you want to contribute I'd be happy to include them on the docs site as well (after testing, of course).*

### So what's going on with Regolith?

Yeah, it's been quiet. Sorry about that. Reality got a bit real in the last month or two and I needed to divert my focus for a bit. This is a 1-person show after all; sometimes life gets in the way. Thank you all for your patience as I've been a bit slow to respond to messages recently.

The server costs never stopped though, so for those of you who stuck with me with your Ko-fi donations thank you so much! The margins are really tight but it's all still paying for itself so as long as that remains true we march on!

**Nyx is coming** and with it some big changes for mining. For those who have been asking:

- Support for the new Salvage refining mechanic is planned.
- Nyx is coming with its new mineables ores.
- There is a bit of a bug backlog that needs attacking so expect some motion there.

Additionally I have one or two side projects for features I'm not quite ready to anounce yet since I'm still not 100% sure they can be accomplished but stay tuned!
