title: Where are the backgrounds?
---

:::info TL;DR #1

Regolith will no longer use AI-generated images due to ethical, environmental, and moral concerns about the technology.

:::

:::warning TL;DR #2

If you haven't read Matthew Inman (of The Oatmeal)'s [A cartoonist's review of AI art](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/ai_art) go and read that. He says everything better than I ever could and what follows is just a poorer, less creative version of that.

:::

You may have noticed that [Regolith.rocks](https://regolith.rocks) is a little simpler these days. As of this moment I've made the decision to remove any AI-generated images from the site and commit to this policy going forward.

The "art" in question was mainly the background images behind the site itself. Luckily the majority of the graphic design, icons, banners etc. so removing them isn't that much work.

### *"Ok, but why? And why now?"*

Let's start with the fact that I'm basically Benny the spaceman from the lego movie.

As a kid if you placed me in a chair with crayons and a diner placemat or concert program what you'd get in return is A). hours of silence and B). an unending, bottomless cascade of pictures of spaceships. The word "obsession" almost feels quaint. In my mind I was [Ralph McQuarrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_McQuarrie)

Even today, when I see fantastic sci-fi concept art, that inner child wakes up with a squeal of joy and does a little chicken dance in my brain. So you can imagine when tools like Midjourney came online and I could type my thoughts into a box and get out something that looked like it came straight off of [Syd Mead's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syd_Mead) drafting table. I didn't ask a lot of questions. This thing was manifesting my imagination and the allure of that silenced every other voice.

When you picture something in your head and type it into a box and the infernal machine spits out visions from your wildest imagination rendered in the style of Ralph McQuarrie or John Schoenherr I cannot even... I just can't.

We're a few years in now and the dialog around these tools has grown. I heard and agreed with all the arguments around stolen art for training, compensating artists fairly, eco-effects etc. but I thought "this is just a stupid little hobby project. I'm not really hurting anyone". (*Note: Oof. Typing that last sentence was hard.*) 

Last week google released their new NanoBanana product so I logged on and then a few prompts later, voila:

I mean, YEAH RIGHT?!?! YEAH!!! Talk about understanding the assignment. This wasn't slop; not exactly anyway. I wouldn't have hired an artist to do this. This was just me having fun right? RIGHT?!? I posted the new pics on Bluesky and went to bed.

The next day there were comments. Not a backlash, not really. I didn't anger the internet beast or anything. There were just some people asking me why I felt the need to use AI. The subtext was disappointment. This was all it took to finally make me take a hard look at AI images, especially how it pertains to hobby projects. I won't keep you in suspense; here's what I've decided:

1. AI is trained unethically and there's no getting around that.
2. Every piece of art should be made by a human who is compensated fairly.
3. AI is developed, controlled and entirely funded by people I wouldn't trust with a pack of matches let alone the fate of the world.
4. The ecological impact of AI datacenters cannot be justified.
5. It feels gross.

Let's go point-by-point:

### 1. AI is trained unethically

This is really simple: AI is trained on stolen art. The artists did not consent to their work being sucked up into these models. I don't need to explain any more than that. [Better writers than me have already done it](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/conferences/article/97528-unethical-ai-training-harms-creators-and-society-argues-ai-pioneer.html).

### 2. Hire a human

This is where things get a bit sticky. I know artists; I like artists. I want artists to be compensated for their work. 

But here's the thing: I would never have paid an artist to do those backgrounds because there was never any budget for that. I could have done them myself but I chose to spend those precious hours of free time on the app instead of the backgrounds. I think this point is what so bear with me and we'll talk more about this below.

### 3. AI is Developed by People Unsuited for the Responsibility

Again, amazingly, what is bad dystopian fiction in 2015 is suddenly pretty uncontroversial in 2025. A tool that has the power to end humanity (even before it gains sentience or whatever we think that is) in the hands of people who lack empathy. What a time to be alive. 

### 4. The environment

While it is possible that AI technically has the potential to solve fusion and unlimited power it also might burn the whole world before it does so this feels like a catch-22.

> That's some catch, that Catch-22
> -- Joesph Heller

As usual, the [environmental impacts](https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117) of all of this impact vulnerable people first in the form of increased energy prices, water availability and quality problems, decimation of small communities etc.  

### 5. *It* feels gross and now *I* feel gross

Given how much AI slop there is now and how the dead internet theory I've found there's a growing distaste for AI art, even when it's not strictly slop. What's worse is the delta between the joy of the thing itself followed by the drop when you discover how it was made makes me feel even worse. It's like a windchill effect for visual media. 

## Hobby Projects are different...right?

I feel like the hobbyest angle of generative AI hasn't gotten quite enough discussion so that's where I can add a little bit of value.

Let's be really clear: Regolith is a hobby project. Nearly every line of HTML, JS, CSS etc. was written by my stubby fingers after work, on weekends or on holiday. Every expense is out of pocket. Kofi Donations have been great and have covered the server costs... but only barely. A few people have volunteered their time to help (and I am grateful) but just about 99% of everything is my fingers tippity tapping out code.

I want to have good art but there is no budget for me to compensate anyone fairly to do it and doing it myself would rob from features and bug fixes.

If I wasn't going to hire an artist and I was only going to do it myself, am I simply robbing myself? And, when a new, apparently low-cost tool arrives on the scene with a big friendly button that says "Make it better" that's pretty enticing. We all have reasons to push that button or not. For me it wasn't laziness but the realization that every hour I save is another feature I can implement or another bug I can fix on Regolith. Also it made my inner child happy.

I feel like when a company fires its graphic designers, developers, office workers in favour of AI agents so that CEOs can have stock buybacks and bigger bonuses that's a cartoonishly clear, unambiguous evil. But what about the hobbyist who can use AI to make more things more better for more people?

"If you can't afford to buy it fairly you shouldn't have it" is a great and virtuous stance but in practice it's more of a compromise by inches. What if I just use it to get ideas about framing, lighting and composition of my images then do the rest myself? What if I just scan through other people's AI renders to get ideas? Maybe I'd be more willing to entertain these compromises if the other reasons listed above didn't exist. As it stands though it's a tsunami of arguments that destroys my little argument sandcastle.

## So where do we go from here?

Luckily the icons, graphic design, CSS are all 100% free-range human and [made by meat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6JFTmQCFHg) so they can just stay put. The backgrounds are easy so they're the first to go. The little banner images are gone too. I've got a few little icons and "share this" images and then that about does it. 

If you're a creator and you're still using AI art I'm not going to call you out. Everyone must draw their own lines. The world is a fabulously complex and nuanced place. I submit this simply as part of the conversation and to sort out my own ideas on the subject.

There's a separate but related conversation we probably all need to have about AI coding tools but I'm way too tired for that right now.
