A Regolith session is a collection of mining, salvage or survey data that you collect while playing Star Citizen. 


### Why do sessions close automatically after 72 hours?

### Can closed sessions be reopened?

Yes. You can always reopen a session if you need to add more data to it. You can find a button for this in the session settings.
