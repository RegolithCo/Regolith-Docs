### How does data submission work?
When you scout a rock cluster, ROC Gem cluster or salvage site in your normal sessions you will have the option to contribute this data (on by default) to the global stats pool.

### So, any survey data I collect in any session will be included?

Yes, as long as you have the "Survey Corps" checkbox enabled in your scan settings. This will include all your scans in the global stats.

### Why should I enlist?

There are several reasons to do this:
- It helps the community by providing more data to generate the charts.
- It helps you by providing more accurate data for your own use.
- For clout or just to see your score increase on the leaderboard.
- Periodically we may offer small incentives to those who contribute the most data.
- It's a lightweight form of exploration gameplay that Star Citizen so far is lacking.
- Maybe you like scanning and finding rocks more than you like mining them.

### Can I add scan data from before I joined?

Yes! You will need to go back to your previous scans and enable the "Survey Corps" checkbox on each scan though. Also don't forget to add location data and a rock class if you still remember it.

### I added scans but they aren't showing up!

Collating the scan data is a little more expensive so we do it every hour. If your data isn't showing after an hour then check:

- Did you sign up for the Survey Corps on the [profile page](https://regolith.rocks/profile/survey)?
- Is your leaderboard name set? Your name will show as "USER-####" until you choose a leaderboard name. We do this so that you can opt-in and not have your name revealed if you don't want it to be.
- Did you check the "Survey Corps" checkbox on your scan? If you did your data will be included but not your name.


### What's an Epoch? Is that like a version of Star Citizen?
Loosely, yes. An epoch is a period of time where the general distribution of ores in the game hasn't changed. For example, if CIG hasn't changed the ore distributions from 3.24 to 4.0.1 then they can be said to be part of the same epoch.

When the epoch changes (decided by consultation with the community) we reset all the stats and need to start fresh surveys to collect new data. Old epoch data should still be available going forward to help with the lack of data after an epoch change but before users have had time to survey it properly.


### What happens if I leave the Corps?
If you leave the Corps any scouting finds from that point onward will no longer be included in the global stats. Your existing data will still be included though. You can re-enlist at any time.

### What are the best practices for a Surveyor?

- Survey every cluster you find, not just the valuable ones. We're trying to get a complete picture of the system and the probability of finding valuable rocks. *Every scan counts equally!*
- Scan every rock in a cluster. Cluster size and composition is important.
- Survey in places with less data. There are point bonuses offered for systems where there is less data to incentivize this. Check the bonus chart for details of which gravity wells offer bonuses.
- Use OCR capture if possible. It makes scanning WAY less tedious and increases the accuracy of your scans. If the OCR doesn't pick up everything correctly you can always correct it after and it's still
