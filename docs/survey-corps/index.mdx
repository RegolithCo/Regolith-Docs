The Regolith Survey Corps is a group of elite users who venture out into the black to report on the state of industrial resources in the verse.

When you enlist with the Regolith Survey Corps your Scouting data will be combined with others to generate the [location and composition charts](/survey/ores). Just by scouting rocks, gems and wrecks normally you will help discover the best places to mine and salvage in the 'verse'.
